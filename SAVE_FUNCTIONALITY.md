## Data Storage

## Technical Details

### What Gets Saved
- All nodes and their positions
- All connections between nodes
- Node data (text, images, settings)
- Canvas zoom and position
- Template information
- Timestamp and metadata

### Auto-Save Behavior
- Triggers every 30 seconds automatically
- Also triggers when you make changes (with 10-second cooldown)
- Saves to temporary storage if no project is currently loaded
- Updates existing projects in real-time

### Project Structure
```json
